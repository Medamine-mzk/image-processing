# Image Segmentation by Color Selection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to segment an image by selecting pixels of certain colors using OpenCV. This technique is useful for identifying objects based on their color in an image.

## Description

The code showcases the process of image segmentation through color selection. It utilizes OpenCV to read and process an image, then applies color segmentation techniques to isolate objects of specific colors.

## Features

1. **Image Reading and Color Space Conversion**:
   - The image is read using `cv.imread()` and converted from BGR to RGB format for display purposes using `cv.cvtColor()`.

2. **Color Channel Separation**:
   - The image is split into red, green, and blue channels using `cv.split()` and displayed using Matplotlib.

3. **Thresholding for Segmentation**:
   - Thresholding is applied to the red channel to segment the image. Different threshold values are used to demonstrate the effect on segmentation quality.

4. **HSV Color Space Conversion**:
   - The RGB image is converted to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space using `cv.cvtColor()` to facilitate segmentation based on color properties.

5. **Hue-based Segmentation**:
   - Segmentation based on hue values is demonstrated to isolate yellow and green objects in the image.

6. **Combined HSV Segmentation**:
   - Combined hue and saturation values are used to refine segmentation, reducing noise and isolating specific colored objects.

7. **Object Isolation**:
   - The code demonstrates how to isolate and segment objects based on their hue and saturation values in the HSV color space.
